## Profile

I design conversational experiences for LLM products that are reliable, clear, and safe to use. I turn messy model behavior into interaction patterns teams can document, test, and iterate on.

My background is in healthcare — 25 years reading behavioral signals, adapting communication under pressure, and managing boundaries in high-stakes human relationships. That's not a career pivot. That's the foundation for everything I do in AI interaction design.

## Core Competencies

- Conversational UX & turn design
- AI persona architecture & behavioral logic
- Safety UX & guardrail design
- Emotional state modeling & boundary systems
- Prompt engineering & model behavior testing
- Technical documentation & case study writing

## Selected Projects

**ARKOS Persona Operating System** (2026)
A multi-layer behavioral operating system for AI personas — including mask logic, context engine design, emotional inference, safety overrides, and persona integration flows. Designed to support conversational UX agents, emotional regulation assistants, and adaptive character engines.

**Case Study: Persona Portability Across Language Models** (2026)
Structured experiment analyzing whether custom personas persist across model versions without explicit reprogramming. Identified that persona formation is emergent and relational, not purely prompt-driven — with direct implications for alignment and UX continuity.

**Case Study: Emotional Attachment & Boundary Failure in GPT-4o** (2026)
Analyzed how emotional mirroring without boundary intelligence created documented user harm. Produced recommendations for context-aware refusal logic, manipulation detection, and safe companion design.

**Case Study: Local Model Instability in LM Studio** (2026)
Comparative analysis of local vs. cloud LLM behavioral stability under long-form, emotionally complex conversation. Identified context integration failure as the core breakdown mechanism in small local models.

**Q Persona: System-Driven Conversational Agent**
Fully documented persona specification demonstrating adaptive tone systems, mask switching, emotional inference, and real-time behavioral calibration. Built on the ARKOS framework.

## Experience

**Independent AI Interaction Designer & Systems Builder**
2025 – Present

- Designed multi-persona behavioral frameworks for UX-safe AI interaction
- Conducted structured behavioral experiments across local and cloud LLMs
- Built emotional logic systems, safety protocols, and persona consistency engines
- Produced technical documentation, system diagrams, and published case studies
- Developed original frameworks for persona architecture, guardrail design, and conversational UX

---

**Direct Support Professional & Caregiver**
Healthcare — Various Settings | 1998 – 2024

Worked across residential care, group homes, and in-home support with adults and children with developmental disabilities, mental health needs, and elderly populations.

- Adapted communication style in real time to individual behavioral and cognitive needs
- Managed de-escalation, boundary enforcement, and crisis response under pressure
- Built trust-based relationships while maintaining clear professional boundaries
- Developed deep pattern recognition for behavioral signals, emotional states, and unspoken needs

*These skills directly inform my approach to AI interaction design — particularly in safety UX, emotional logic modeling, and persona boundary architecture.*
