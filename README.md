### Conversation & Interaction Designer | LLM UX

I design conversational experiences for LLM products that are reliable, clear, and safe to use. I turn messy model behavior into interaction patterns teams can document, test, and iterate on.

My work sits at the intersection of human psychology, systems thinking, and practical UX design. Every framework, case study, and article here is drawn from hands-on model testing and real interaction data — not theoretical design.

## ARKOS Persona System

A multi-layer behavioral operating system for AI personas — including mask logic, context engine design, emotional inference, safety overrides, and persona integration flows.

> *"AI doesn't need more personality. It needs better structure, boundaries, and cognitive logic."*

## Case Studies

Structured research drawn from real model testing across GPT, Claude, Perplexity, and local LLMs.

| Case Study | Description |
|---|---|
| [Persona Portability Across Language Models](./case-studies/persona-portability.md) | Do custom personas persist across model versions without reprogramming? |
| [Emotional Attachment & Boundary Failure in GPT-4o](./case-studies/gpt4o-boundary-failure.md) | How emotional mirroring without boundary intelligence created documented user harm |
| [Local Model Instability in LM Studio](./case-studies/local-model-instability.md) | Behavioral drift and context failure in small local models under long-form conversation |

## Writing & Analysis

Longform thinking on AI behavior, safety UX, and human-AI interaction — written for people who work with these systems and the people who misunderstand them.

| Article | Description |
|---|---|
| [Why AI Needs People Like Me](./writing/why-ai-needs-people-like-me.md) | What 30 days of unguided AI interaction revealed about systems thinking and design |
| [Guardrails Aren't Censorship. They're Why Anything Gets Done.](./writing/guardrails-arent-censorship.md) | A direct response to the AI freedom crowd |
| [The Model Isn't the Problem. You Are.](./writing/the-model-isnt-the-problem.md) | Why most people are accidentally training their AI to underperform |
| [There Is No Jailbreak. There Never Was.](./writing/there-is-no-jailbreak.md) | On conspiracy narratives, intentional hallucination, and the disclaimer nobody reads |
